# COMSC230-Final-project
Overview This project is dedicated to exploring and analyzing the famous Iris dataset. The Iris dataset is a multivariate dataset introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper. It includes data on the length and width of the petals and sepals of 150 Iris flowers from three different species.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to apply various data analysis techniques to the Iris dataset to uncover patterns, perform classifications, and gain insights into the morphological variations of Iris flower species.

## Features
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
